Even though I recently got a new iPad for note-taking (which, by the way, has changed my life), I still love love my pens for bullet journaling. 
Here's a list of pens that have changed my life.
- pilot juice up 04
- pilot juice retractable pen 0.38 gel ink
- mildliner burnt orange
- muji 0.38 in five colors
- muji 0.5 gel pen black
- zebra sarasa 0.5 retractable gel ink pen vintage colors
- pentel fude touch sign pen, felt pen like brush strokes
